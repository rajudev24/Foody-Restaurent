            time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a
            wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables,
            and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. Plus cake for dessert.</p>
